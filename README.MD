# Swedish Rom Translations
For fun, and no profit.

## Some background 
These were originally created between 1999 and 2002 as a sort of technical archeology work. We delved deep into the innards of our old favourite games and poked around using various tools such as hex editors to see what was possible. This was good fun and we learnt a lot.

## Some history 
Unfortunately the old (fancy) web site at Emucamp has not been online for years, altough it can still be viewed at [the internet archive](http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.emucamp.com/mhhg) if you want to peruse some internet history.

I decided I wanted this stuff to be discoverable online, as it might bring fun and learning to someone else. So here it is :)

## Other resources
Some of these translations are featured over at [Romhacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/community/821/) 

Surprisingly we were also mentioned in [an academic paper](https://metalproject.net/general/rom-hacking-academic-paper/) some years ago.

The tool of choice for editing back in the day was the almighty [Hexposure](http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/350/), now evidently rewritten for "modern" systems. But I'm certain there are hundreds of new cool tools nowadays :)
