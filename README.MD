#Swedish Rom Translations
For fun, and no profit.

These were originally created between 1999 and 2002 as a sort of technical archeology work. We delved deep into the innards of our old favourite games and poked around using various tools such as hex editors to see what was possible. This was good fun and we learnt a lot.

Unfortunately the old (fancy) web site at Emucamp has not been online for years, altough it can still be viewed at http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.emucamp.com/mhhg if you want to peruse some internet history.

I decided I wanted this stuff to be discoverable online, as it might bring fun and learning to someone else. So here it is :)

Some of these translations are featured over at https://www.romhacking.net/community/821/ 

Surprisingly we were also featured in an academic paper some years ago https://metalproject.net/general/rom-hacking-academic-paper/
