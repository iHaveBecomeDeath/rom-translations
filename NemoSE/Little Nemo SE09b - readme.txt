1. Version History
==================

v0.9b August 13 1999
------------------
First official beta release of this patch, which translates the Little Nemo NES rom to 
swedish! Only 2 things left now. Everything, including credits, dialogue, intro and the 
stages is now in swedish, and all the three swedish characters are redrawn and in there. 

But - at the title screen, I have not been able to fit in an A with umlaut because of an 
extremely limited charset at that point, which means that one letter is replaced by "A" 
for now. And in the game, and this is the big annoying thing, when you start on a stage, 
it will still say "Dream 1 - Svampskogen" for example. This is because I have not anywhere 
in the game been able to find this specific text, which annoys me, especially since I know 
that the game uses the standard charset there. But otherwise it is now complete. 

If someone would be so kind as to play it through and see if there are any minor 
bugs left, please do (I just did, and corrected a few, and I don't want to play it through 
again right now). Enjoy!


v0.1 August 10 1999
-------------------
Just begun. Testing and early beta-testing (checking space and stuff) in process.


2. The files
============
The zip archive contains 2 files, the readme you are now reading, and "NemoSE9b.ips", the
actual patch file.


3. Usage
=========
In order to use this, you will need a Little Nemo NES rom, which I will _not_ give to you,
even if I could, I would not, since it is illegal to distribute roms. So don't bother
me about that. Second, you will need an IPS patcher program, available in may places, one 
being our homepage, with the aid of which you will apply the patch file to an _english_ 
Little Nemo NES rom. This rom must not previously have been patched or altered in any way, 
since the patch will not work then.


4. Questions, comments or suggestions
=====================================
If you have anything constructive to say, if you like this translation, if you want to
know what other translations/hacks I have done/am doing, or perhaps even can offer some
help with the limited charset at times, or the word "DREAM" (see 1.)- contact me at 
kalle@eyecom.se.

We also have a website, which thanks to Zoop of EmuCamp, now is in a nice place. See bottom 
for adress.

5. Thanks
=========
Thanks go out to all of the good emu sites out there (like Archaic Ruins, EmuCamp, 
Retrogames, Zophar's Domain, Emulation.net and so on) for being there, and being really 
nice guys. I also want to thank RoboBengt/Johan Sånesson (death_march@hotmail.com) for 
being generally helpful, and working with me on other projects. Special thanks to Zoop 
of EmuCamp for hosting our site. Also in graceful memory of the great, but now gone, 
emulation news service (www.emunews.net).
