1. Version History
==================

V0.99 August 16 1999
--------------------
Whoa! Found the credits (for all three endings), translated them, mission accomplished. 
We have also redrawn some graphics - the tombstone at the end, and the persistent letter 
"L" for Level, that should be "N", and now is. We could not find this letter, no matter 
how hard we searched, until we realized it was in the graphics and not in the text. 
The game is now fully translated, and all we need now is the final swedish letter, 
still replaced by "A".


V0.9 August 11 1999
-------------------
First official release of this patch which translates Castlevania 2 - Simon's Quest for NES 
to swedish. Everything except for the credits/epilogue translated (unable to find them), 
but it is hopefully in english, and not mixed up with swedish characters (we would not be 
bothered to finish the game again to check it). Two of the three swedish characters are 
included, and one replaced by "A", which works well. Have fun.

v0.9b August 10 1999
--------------------
Beta testing needed.


2. The files
============
The zip archive contains 2 files, the readme you are now reading, and "cs2se099.ips", the
actual patch file.


3. Usage
=========
In order to use this, you will need a Castlevania 2 NES rom, which I will _not_ give to 
you, even if I could, I would not, since it is illegal to distribute roms. So don't bother
me about that. Second, you will need an IPS patcher program, available at many places
in many different flavors and colors, with the aid of which you will apply the patch
file to an _english_ Castlevania 2 NES rom. This rom must not previously have been 
patched or altered in any way, since the patch will not work then.


4. Questions, comments or suggestions
=====================================
If you have anything constructive to say, if you like this translation, if you want to
know what other translations/hacks I have done/am doing, or perhaps even can offer some
help with a project - contact me at kalle@eyecom.se or RoboBengt at death_march@hotmail.com
We also have a website, which thanks to Zoop of EmuCamp, now is in a nice place. See bottom 
for adress.
(Note: We are in no way affiliated with NCL, NOA or Konami).


5. Thanks
=========
Thanks go out to all of the good emu sites out there (like Archaic Ruins, EmuCamp, 
Retrogames, Zophar's Domain, Emulation.net and so on) for being there, and being really 
nice guys. Special thanks to Zoop of EmuCamp for hosting our site. Also in graceful 
memory of the great, but now gone, emulation news service (www.emunews.net).
