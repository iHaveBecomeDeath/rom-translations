1. Version History
==================

v0.9 August 17 1999
-------------------
All swedish letters now available, title screen redrawn and text re-edited. I have left 
the staff titles intact, and the piece "Look up the manual..." is rather hard to edit, 
since it is all graphics, and I'm not quite sure which piece belongs where...


v0.8 August 8 1999
------------------
This is a a patch that will translate the whole Zelda.nes rom into swedish! This is the
first release, all before have been private betas, and it contains two of the three
specific swedish characters (the third is replaced by "A", which works very well). 
Unfortunately there are still a few loose ends to this translation, in the credits. The
text is a bit jumpy, since the rows don't finish where I want them to (although it is
still fully understandable, but not very good-looking), and at the end (of the first round) 
some text is surrounded by mysterious numbers and letters, that may or may not disappear 
in a soon-to-come release. But anyway, the whole text in the game is translated.
One  little bug though (either caused by a game-genie code, or by my hacking, I don't 
know which) is that left of the waterfall, where you get the white sword, the stairs end 
before the ground, meaning that you can't get down there. (But solve it, should you 
encounter it, by pausing, and pressing up and "A" simultaneously on controller 2. This 
brings up the save dialog, which lets you start from the start-point, without having to 
reset the game.)


2. The files
============
The zip archive contains 2 files, the readme you are now reading, and "zeldse09.ips", the
actual patch file.


3. Usage
=========
In order to use this, you will need a Zelda NES rom, which I will _not_ give to 
you, even if I could, I would not, since it is illegal to distribute roms. So don't bother
me about that. Second, you will need an IPS patcher program, available at many places
in many different flavors and colors, with the aid of which you will apply the patch
file to an _english_ Zelda NES rom. This rom must not previously have been 
patched or altered in any way, since the patch will not work then. Have fun!


4. Questions, comments or suggestions
=====================================
If you have anything constructive to say, if you like this translation, if you want to
know what other translations/hacks I have done/am doing, or perhaps even can offer some
help with a project - contact me at kalle@eyecom.se.
We also have a website, which thanks to Zoop of EmuCamp, now is in a nice place. See bottom 
for adress.

5. Thanks
=========
Thanks go out to all of the good emu sites out there (like Archaic Ruins, EmuCamp, 
Retrogames, Zophar's Domain, Emulation.net and so on) for being there, and being really 
nice guys. Special thanks to Zoop of EmuCamp for hosting our site. Also in graceful memory 
of the great, but now gone, emulation news service (www.emunews.net). Thanks to Nintendo 
for making the superb Zelda-series, which have to be seen as my favorite games of all time 
(all 5 of them, so far).
