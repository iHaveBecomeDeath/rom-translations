1. Version History
==================

v0.9 August 17 1999
-------------------
Another letter, a little more and better translation. The credits are also translated now, 
and thanks to the new letter I fit in, it looks much, much better now. No glitches, no 
nothing, just one character missing, replaced by "A", much better now than "AA" and "AE".


v0.7 August 6 1999
------------------
First official release of this patch, which translates the Zelda2.nes rom to swedish!
Everything in the whole game, except for the finishing lines "producer, staff" and so on,
is completely in swedish. Though only one of the specific swedish characters is available,
the text is fully readable and understandable (if you know swedish, of course). I have
played through the entire game and talked to everyone, so no little glitches are left.

v0.7b August 3 1999
-------------------
Only released to my beta testers (including me), it was translated in every place, 
except for the credits, and was not played through and bug-tested.


2. The files
============
The zip archive contains 2 files, the readme you are now reading, and "z2se09.ips", the
actual patch file.


3. Usage
=========
In order to use this, you will need a Zelda 2 NES rom, which I will _not_ give to you,
even if I could, I would not, since it is illegal to distribute roms. So don't bother
me about that. Second, you will need an IPS patcher program, available at many places
in many different flavors and colors, with the aid of which you will apply the patch
file to an _english_ Zelda 2 NES rom. This rom must not previously have been patched 
or altered in any way, since the patch will not work then.


4. Questions, comments or suggestions
=====================================
If you have anything constructive to say, if you like this translation, if you want to
know what other translations/hacks I have done/am doing, or perhaps even can offer some
help with the two missing characters (graphic hack needed) - contact me at kalle@eyecom.se.
We also have a website, which thanks to Zoop of EmuCamp, now is in a nice place. See bottom 
for adress.

5. Thanks
=========
Thanks go out to all of the good emu sites out there (like Archaic Ruins, EmuCamp, 
Retrogames, Zophar's Domain, Emulation.net and so on) for being there, and being really 
nice guys. I also want to thank RoboBengt/Johan Sånesson (death_march@hotmail.com) for 
aiding me with translation, beta-testing and playing through the game. Special thanks to 
Zoop of EmuCamp for hosting our site. Also in graceful memory of the great, but now gone, 
emulation news service (www.emunews.net).
