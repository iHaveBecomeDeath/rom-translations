## 1. Version History

### v0.9 September 15 1999
Translation as good as complete! 
All cutscenes translated and also the credits. I could not find the in game text though, 
hence I couldn't translate it. For example: Stage, Score and so on...  

## 2. The files
The zip archive contains 2 files, the readme you are now reading, and "ngdnse09.ips", the
actual patch file.

## 3. Usage
In order to use this, you will need a Ninja Gaiden NES rom, which I will _not_ give to you,
even if I could, I would not, since it is illegal to distribute roms. So don't bother
me about that. Second, you will need an IPS patcher program, one can be found in the 
download section of our page, with the aid of which you will apply the patch
file to an _english_ Ninja Gaiden NES rom. This rom must not previously have been patched 
or altered in any way, since the patch will not work then.

## 4. Questions, comments or suggestions
If you have anything constructive to say, if you like this translation, if you want to
know what other translations/hacks I have done/am doing, or perhaps even can offer some
help with the bug-testing - contact me at [email_removed].
We now have a webpage, and thanks to Zoop, at a nice place (see bottom for adress).
(Note: I am in no way affiliated with NOA,NCL or TECMO).

## 5. Thanks
Thanks go out to all of the good emu sites out there (like Archaic Ruins, EmuCamp, 
Retrogames, Zophar's Domain, Emulation.net and so on) for being there, and being really 
nice guys. Special thanks to Zoop of EmuCamp, for hosting our site. Also in graceful 
memory of the great, but now gone, emulation news service (www.emunews.net).
More thanks to Patrik Magnusson for being a great friend and a fantastic drummer in
our band. Sad to see you go man...
Also, thanks to MetalHead for teaching me what I know about translating, and for
drinking beer with me without complaining. :)
