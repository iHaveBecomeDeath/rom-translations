1. Version History
==================

v1.01b August 16 1999
---------------------
Minor corrections, like dots and commas in the wrong place.


v1.0b August 11 1999
--------------------
First official release! All text translated. All Swedish characters exist. (Yay!)
Initial beta testing complete, where a MAJOR error was discovered which crashed the whole 
game!! With much help from MetalHead, the problem was solved, and beta testing continued. 
A lot of minor errors fixed. Now the time has come for me to ask for your help. I need 
someone, who understands Swedish to play through the game once more to check for errors. 



v0.7b August 10 1999
--------------------
Translation complete! Except for 1 minor place where some code was placed and 1 sentence 
which I had a problem with, since I didn't know the context of the dialogue. Beta testing 
begun.



2. The files
============
The zip archive contains 2 files, the readme you are now reading, and "mgse101b.ips", the
actual patch file.


3. Usage
=========
In order to use this, you will need a Metal Gear NES rom, which I will _not_ give to you,
even if I could, I would not, since it is illegal to distribute roms. So don't bother
me about that. Second, you will need an IPS patcher program, one can be found in the 
download section of our page, with the aid of which you will apply the patch
file to an _english_ Metal Gear NES rom. This rom must not previously have been patched 
or altered in any way, since the patch will not work then.


4. Questions, comments or suggestions
=====================================
If you have anything constructive to say, if you like this translation, if you want to
know what other translations/hacks I have done/am doing, or perhaps even can offer some
help with the bug-testing - contact me at death_march@hotmail.com.
We now have a webpage, and thanks to Zoop, at a nice place (see bottom for adress).
(Note: I am in no way affiliated with NOA,NCL or KONAMI).


5. Thanks
=========
Thanks go out to all of the good emu sites out there (like Archaic Ruins, EmuCamp, 
Retrogames, Zophar's Domain, Emulation.net and so on) for being there, and being really 
nice guys. Special thanks to Zoop of EmuCamp, for hosting our site. Also in graceful 
memory of the great, but now gone, emulation news service (www.emunews.net).
Also, thanks to MetalHead for teaching me what I know about translating, and for
drinking beer with me without complaining. :)
