1. Version History
==================


v1.0 April 29 2000
----------------------
The translation is complete! All cutscenes, the credits and all in-game text has
been translated. And also all has been thoroughly play-tested to ensure maximum
quality. Enjoy!
(Note: I actually started work on this game sometime in october, just before I got my
new job developing applications and web-based database-solutions. Since then I have not 
had the time to do stuff like this, but as you see, I am getting back on track.)


2. The files
============
The zip archive contains 2 files, the readme you are now reading, and "ngdn2se1.ips", the
actual patch file.


3. Usage
=========
In order to use this, you will need a Ninja Gaiden 2 NES rom, which I will _not_ give to you, even if I could, I would not, since it is illegal to distribute roms. So don't bother
me about that. Second, you will need an IPS patcher program, one can be found in the 
download section of our page, with the aid of which you will apply the patch
file to an _english_ Ninja Gaiden 2 NES rom. This rom must not previously have been 
patched or altered in any way, since the patch will not work then.


4. Questions, comments or suggestions
=====================================
If you have anything constructive to say, if you like this translation, if you want to
know what other translations/hacks I have done/am doing, or perhaps even can offer some
help with the bug-testing - contact me at kalle@eyecom.se.
We also have a webpage, and thanks to Zoop and Uzplayer, at a nice place 
(see bottom for adress).

5. Thanks
=========
Thanks go out to all of the good emu sites out there (like Archaic Ruins, EmuCamp, 
Retrogames, Zophar's Domain, Emulation.net and so on) for being there, and being really 
nice guys. I also want to thank RoboBengt/Johan Sånesson (death_march@hotmail.com) for 
being generally helpful, playing and recording stuff with me in a couple of metal-bands, playing games with me, drinking beer and for working with me on other projects. Special thanks go to Zoop and Uzplayer of EmuCamp for hosting our site. Also in graceful memory of the great, but now sadly gone, emulation news service (www.emunews.net).
