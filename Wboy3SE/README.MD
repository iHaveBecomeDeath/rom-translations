## 1. Version History

### v0.7b August 16 1999
The problem with the word "GOLD" is partially solved, when you pick up gold, the whole 
word will display correctly, but otherwise it's just GLD (since the game used the same 
string when pausing too, but with "U" at different adresses making the "U" become some 
incomprehensible graphics part when pausing.) Fixed a few little errors, but I know that 
there are still some spacing-errors, thus the beta, where words are too long and such 
things.

### v0.5b August 7 1999
First beta release of this patch, which translates the Wonderboy3.sms rom to swedish!
All text like equipment, dialogue and credits (except for positions of the staff) is now
completely in swedish. All swedish letters are there too, so no misunderstandings.

Only a few, but _big_, things left,  including "push start" at title screen (graphics that
I have not found yet), "dragon" when fighting bosses and the word "gold", now only "GLD".

(Note on the last two items: this is because the rom only contains one set of characters.
Where many other games have one for each specific situation, wonderboy3 picks a few letters
from the character-set at every given time, except for dialogues/credits and such. This
means that the letter "U" in "GULD" - swedish for gold - is not at the usual address,
although the game uses it there, so all I get is a tile of graphics instead of "U" when
trying. This can be solved though, what is more of a problem is "DRAGON" when fighting
bosses, since the game specifically uses the letter "O" which I have redrawn, and the
letters of the swedish word "DRAKE" are not all there. So some assembly coding is needed
there...)


### v0.4 August 5 1999
Not very released, and not bug free.

## 2. The files
The zip archive contains 2 files, the readme you are now reading, and "wb3se07b.ips", the
actual patch file.

## 3. Usage
In order to use this, you will need a Wonder Boy 3 SMS rom, which I will _not_ give to you,
even if I could, I would not, since it is illegal to distribute roms. So don't bother
me about that. Second, you will need an IPS patcher program, available at many places
in many different flavors and colors, with the aid of which you will apply the patch
file to an _english_ Wonder Boy 3 SMS rom. This rom must not previously have been patched 
or altered in any way, since the patch will not work then.


## 4. Questions, comments or suggestions
If you have anything constructive to say, if you like this translation, if you want to
know what other translations/hacks I have done/am doing, or perhaps even can offer some
help with the limited charset at times (see 1.)- contact me at [email_removed].
We also have a website, which thanks to Zoop of EmuCamp, now is in a nice place. See bottom 
for adress.

## 5. Thanks
Thanks go out to all of the good emu sites out there (like Archaic Ruins, EmuCamp, 
Retrogames, Zophar's Domain, Emulation.net and so on) for being there, and being really 
nice guys. I also want to thank RoboBengt/Johan SÃ¥nesson for 
being generally helpful, and working with me on other projects. Special thanks to Zoop 
of EmuCamp for hosting our site. Also in graceful memory of the great, but now gone, 
emulation news service (www.emunews.net).
